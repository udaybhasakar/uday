<p>Sri Chaitanya Techno School is a minor part of an ongoing education scam in Andhra Pradesh by the Sri Chaitanya Educational Group [1]. Since its inception in the mid-80s, the group has been promoting rote learning under the pretext of revolutionizing education in the then state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>Over the years, it has evolved into a behemoth of hundreds of sub organizations that mistreat students, harass them with archaic practices and subject them to unreasonable amounts of stress. Alongside Narayana, its chief competitor, Sri Chaitanya has been running a crippling duopoly in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana leading to the highest percentage of student suicides, among children aged between 12â€“18 since the early 1900s.[2]</p>
